# 100 Days Of Code - Log -(MIHIR PANCHAL)

**Today's Progress**: Made a Photo gallery in which when I hover over an image the empty div will have that image and its alt text in it.

**Thoughts:** I got stuck at changing the background image of the div to the image I hover to. At first I got frustrated but then I finally figured out that using `${}` I can insert variables in a string and using that I solved my issue.
