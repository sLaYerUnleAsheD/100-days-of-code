# 100 Days Of Code - Log -(MIHIR PANCHAL)

### Day 0: April 04, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Made a Photo gallery in which when I hover over an image the empty div will have that image and its alt text in it.

**Thoughts:** I got stuck at changing the background image of the div to the image I hover to. At first I got frustrated but then I finally figured out that using `${}` I can insert variables in a string and using that I solved my issue. 


### Day 1: April 05, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Solved many questions on arrays, numpy and decision-making statements in Python and learned many different methods. 

**Thoughts:** Yesterdays way of inserting expression in a string was very useful in solving sum problems and I had to research over print(f"") in python and some methods, so overall I learned many new things.
